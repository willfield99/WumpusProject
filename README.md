# WumpusProject


This project is an AI implementation of the classic [Hunt the Wumpus] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) Game.

 It is written in python and will require python 3 to run. To run it run the driver with 
 
C:\folder\WumpusProject> python HuntTheWumpus.py

The terminal will ask you to choose whether the wumpi are able to move or not, how many wumpi are in the cave, 
how many Arrows the hero recieves, and how many game simulations you would like to run.
It will then output the game statistics, showing how the AI did.

While this program is stable, The AI is astoundlingly ineffective. Please notify me if it ever wins a game!
